# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-05-06

Welcome to my _new blog_! about learing Astro. I will share my learning journey and experiences with you.

## What I've accompished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my Github.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learnd how to make pages by creating new '.astro' files in the `src/pages` directory.

2. **Making Blog Posts**: I also learned how to create blog posts using Markdown files in the `src/pages/posts` directory.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more updates!
